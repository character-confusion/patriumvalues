It arose from our desire to prevent the return of the state of nature...anarchy. The state of nature, the world before society and the state, is one of chaos and bloodshed. We live in a world with finite resources and hence a world in which there is a constant struggle for power and self-preservation. The anarchic-communes and tribes of the past no longer exist for this reason. They were weak and vulnerable to the selfishness of man. Politics, and the state itself was forged as a tool to protect ourselves from our own selfish nature. If a government is unable to defend its citizens from anarchy then there is no use of that government. Herein lies the purpose of the Adams Estate. We are the defenders of order. The keepers of stability. We are willing to do what we must, regardless of the consequences to ensure that the citizens may exert their physical will in their day to day lives. The state ensures progress by instilling its values into its citizens through early education. Citizens must be taught to value reason and logic and realize that they are all brothers in sisters in arms. The individual's purpose is to serve humanity and must therefore know its role in society. From an early age citizens must be vetted through an education system that allows them to discover the purpose in society. The AE has also created some sort of a cult of personality surrounding the current President, Adams, Hence the name, \"Adams Estate.\"<br>Legislative and political goals: <br>Massive education reform <br>The creation of an Atheist State<br>The outlaw of all drugs including alcohol<br>Total surveillance of citizens <br>The spread of AE ideology to other nations<br>One World State",

We borrow from both the left and the right, melding them together to create a perfect ideology that is twice as better than them separately. We will adopt the socialist belief of taxing the rich in order to help the middle class while also the capitalist belief of taxing the poor to help the middle class, because we only care about the middle path. When driving on the road, we always drive in the middle of the lanes, in order to experience both sides. While we often get into wrecks that way, we are more rational while doing it so it balances out.

The tradeoff of this is that the idle resources of each brain are constantly allocated to form a hivemind, which rough brainpower is equal to the sum of the allocated brainpowers in addition to a self-optimizing AI component.<br>Since everyone inside this mind technically gets what they want in their simulation, the hive's sole actions are those that allow it to maximize itself by absorbing more individuals, improving its intelligence and defending from external threats.<br>Ideologies: Yes",

        "description": "Overview: IMF believes that in order to create a truly free market of equal opportunity, the free market must be spread abroad as to level the playing field. Thus intercon-minarchism is a very militaristic ideology and is imperative of it that it takes charge internationally, securing unstable countries guiding them to prosperity, and dealing with external threats to the freedom of its citizens. However, we believe the state's only functions are to act as an enforcer of the non-aggression principle by providing its citizens with the military, the police and courts, thereby protecting them from aggression, theft, breach of contract, fraud and enforcing property laws.<br>Foreign Policy: When stabilizing a foreign country or a recently war torn region, without sufficient development in place, a system of minarchism is impossible. Because of this any region recently stabilized will fall directly into the hands of the state, where they can use corporatist policies to enact rapid industrialization. This I'd because while it sacrifices the liberty of the people, state run corporatism rebuilds a nation much faster. Once the nation has sufficient infastructure to support a monarchist state, the state will slowly wane its control until it releases control of the nation entirely and installs a minarchist government.<br>By this process, the freedom and prosperity of minarchism can be brought abroad for all peoples.<br>Economy: We emphasize free-market capitalism, based on the idea that markets are the mechanisms that most efficiently leads to wealth.<br>Ideologies: Minarchism, Neoconservatism, Classical Liberalism, Liberal Conservatism.",
